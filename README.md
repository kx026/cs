### Requesting: Send data through RabbitMQ. The number in the parentheses after "body=" will be the length of the generated password and can be set to any integer.
```channel.basic_publish(exchange='', routing_key='CS361', body=(8).to_bytes(2, byteorder='big'))```
### To generate a password, run generator.py first then comm.py. The password will be shown in the window of comm.py. More unique passwords can be generated by running comm.py again.
### Receiving: Consume data from a different channel through RabbitMQ.
```channel.basic_consume(queue='CS361r', on_message_callback=callback, auto_ack=True)```</br>
